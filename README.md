- Hi, I’m @ColbyDub
- I'm mainly interested in software development. Also interested in security and machine learning. I'm very interested in learning to code smart contracts for cryptocurrencies in the future.
- I’m currently learning javascript with nodejs for backend development. In my free time I enjoy learning about cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
- In the future I hope to learn how to code in solidity and haskell. 
- The next projects I'm looking forward to: setting up a bitcoin full node and learning react + nodejs for a full stack project.
